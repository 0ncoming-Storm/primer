Original:
Sequential storage can be quite useful in situations where it is not important to be able to access the data rapidly. Applications like long-term archiving might use magnetic tape, which is cheap ($0.006 per gigabyte), and can accommodate very large amounts of data on a continuous tape.
LTO (Linear Tape-Open) tapes can last up to 30 years in ideal conditions, and when combined with the low cost per GB, they become a good option for long-term offline (not needing to be accessed often) data archiving.

AI Improved version:
Sequential storage can be highly beneficial in scenarios where rapid data access is not a priority. Applications such as long-term data archiving often utilize magnetic tape, which is cost-effective ($0.006 per gigabyte) and capable of storing vast amounts of data on a continuous tape.
LTO (Linear Tape-Open) tapes boast a lifespan of up to 30 years under optimal conditions. When combined with their low cost per gigabyte, they present an attractive solution for long-term offline data archiving, especially when frequent data access is not required.
